## Status: 
*Work in progress*

## Introduction
BoardGameGeek is a popular website with information a wide variety of games, including but not limited to board games. The site has a 'hot' list of games that indicates view of particular games throughout a day. The list updates regularly, potentially a couple of times a day. The purpose here is to grab the game titles from the hotness list and try to create some interesting visualizations over time. More later. :)
